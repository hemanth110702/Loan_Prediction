# Loan Prediction ML Project

Welcome to the Loan Prediction ML Project! This project is designed to predict loan approval likelihood using logistic regression and is based on a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on various features.
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Dataset:** Obtained from Kaggle

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemanth110702/Loan_Prediction.git
   cd Loan_Prediction

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   
### Usage
- Open and run the Loan_Prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
- Explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the logistic regression and KNN models.
